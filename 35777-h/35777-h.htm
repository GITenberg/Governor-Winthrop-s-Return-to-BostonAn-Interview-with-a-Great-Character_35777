<P>
On the seventeenth day of September, A.D. 1880, the two hundred and
fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of the town of Boston, the event
was commemorated, among other ways, by the inauguration of the statue
of John Winthrop, in Scollay Square.  He is represented by the renowned
sculptor in the garb of a gentleman of his day, holding in his hand the
royal charter of the Massachusetts Colony, which he brought over with
him.
</P>

<BR>

<P>
His serene countenance falls like a benediction upon this city of ours,
which shows a wonderful and prosperous growth.  He may be said to be
the founder of the First Church of Boston, of the City itself, and of
this Christian Commonwealth,&mdash;a threefold distinction.  To have been
the founder of a single one of these would have insured his immortal
fame.
</P>

<P>
He was also the author of the covenant of the First Church, which was
gathered in Charlestown, Aug. 27, 1630, and which soon after removed to
the Boston side of Charles River.  The covenant is in these words:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in obedience to His holy and
divine ordinance,&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"We, whose names are hereunder written, being by His most wise and good
providence brought together into this part of America, in the Bay of
Massachusetts, and desirous to unite ourselves into one congregation or
church, under the Lord Jesus Christ, our Head, in such sort as becometh
all those whom He hath redeemed and sanctified to Himself, do hereby
solemnly and religiously (as in His most holy presence) promise and
bind ourselves to walk in all our ways according to the rule of the
Gospel and in all sincere conformity to His holy ordinances, and in
mutual love and respect, each to other, so near as God shall give us
grace."
</P>

<BR>

<P>
Probably there are very few, if any, original documents in America of
so ancient a date which have been preserved, and which are still in
force, as this identical covenant, which has been signed and kept by
hundreds in each generation for nearly three centuries.  Far superior
to the Andover creed, or to any other creed of seminary, council, or
church, it has ever been a bond of union, and not a bone of contention.
Aptly phrased and including all the essential conditions of a vital
church organization, it will stand for centuries to come, and will
outlast all creeds of human invention, ever promoting beneficence and
charity.
</P>

<BR>

<P>
This poem represents the spirit of Governor Winthrop returning to the
city and the capital of the Christian Commonwealth he had founded, and
taking possession of the bodily form which the artist has reproduced of
him, clothed in his own antique costume.  He surveys the extended
limits of Boston, including Charlestown, with Bunker Hill Monument, and
four other townships with hundreds of church steeples pointing to the
sky.  He misses from the old site on Cornhill the single house of
worship where Wilson and Cotton preached, and where he was wont to
expound; but soon he descries from afar, in his mind's eye, standing
where, in his time, the waves of the sea were surging, the beautiful
church edifice and the elegant chapel where five hundred
Sunday-scholars are weekly taught.  He dwells with supreme satisfaction
upon the good deeds done by the church he established, and predicts for
it a still more prosperous future and a greater spiritual growth.  He
recognizes only two things which existed in his day, and have remained
unchanged,&mdash;the church covenant he wrote, as it were, by inspiration,
or at least by a wise forecast of future needs, and the Communion cup
he gave, which has singularly escaped the hazards of fire and the
chances of time, and which has been, ever since, constantly used in the
holy commemorative service.
</P>

<P>
Upon these almost universal changes he makes some appropriate
reflections.  To "sit in the stocks" was a punishment commonly imposed
in his time for various offences.  Richard Frothingham, in his "History
of Charlestown," gives a view of the stocks that were set in the
market-place with this mode of punishment applied.  The view is here
reproduced.  "It was much used," says Frothingham, "and several times
repaired.  A sentence by the selectmen for 'drinking to excess,' shows
that one hour's sitting in the stocks could be compromised by paying
3<I>s.</I> 4<I>d.</I> money."  Winthrop, of course, would be struck with the
different use of the word now so frequently spoken.  From the fact that
all investments of his day are swept out of existence, he predicts that
the properties now held as most secure and reliable will in as long a
time disappear.  He illustrates the superiority of man, in his own best
estate, to all worldly possessions.

His allusion to the vision of Rev. John Wilson, the first minister of
the church, recalls the following passage in his diary as quoted by
Hon. Robert C. Winthrop in his "Life and Letters of John Winthrop,"
vol. 2, page 108.
</P>

<P>
"The pastor of Boston, Mr. Wilson, a very sincere, holy man, ... told
the governour that, before he was resolved to come into this country,
he dreamed he was here, and that he saw a church arise out of the
earth, which grew up and became a marvellous goodly church."
</P>

<BR>

<P>
The present church edifice well answers this description; built with
exquisite taste after a most appropriate design, and bearing the palm
of all the costly churches in the new part of Boston for fitness,
beauty, and permanency.

<P>
The Thursday Lecture, which was the special clerical and social
occasion of his time, he finds abolished; and he observes that the
Thursday Evening Club is now a characteristic feature of Boston.  This
was formed for social, scientific, and literary objects.  Among its
founders and early members were Edward Everett, a member of First
Church, and Hon. Robert C. Winthrop, the distinguished descendant and
representative of the Winthrop family.  The one referred to in this
interview as the then leader of the Club was its late President,
William B. Rogers.  He was a man of superior scientific attainments,
with a power of apt expression and a felicity and fluency of utterance
indeed remarkable.  By his efforts and influence the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology was established,&mdash;a lasting monument of his
zeal for technical science, the most needed factor in popular
education.  In making an address to the Institute at its Commencement
exercises, May 30, 1882, he was struck with death; he left the very
place of his heart's and life's devotion for the spirit land of
Winthrop.  His predecessors in the office of President of the Club were
John C. Warren, the nephew of General Joseph Warren, Edward Everett, J.
Mason Warren, and Bishop Manton Eastburn.  The historic mantle of the
office has now been cast on Colonel Theodore Lyman, upon whose
well-stored and lofty head honors have fallen thick, but no faster than
merited.
</P>

<BR>

<P>
Josiah Quincy the elder, the second on the roll of Boston's
distinguished Mayors, declared that the City might well adopt Winthrop
as its patron saint.  His was an ideal, saintly life, and his
character, in a sense, supernatural.  He bore success and defeat in a
political election with like equanimity, a trait that, as it were, by a
law of heredity marks with special honor his living representative.
Whether in office or out, and possessing large estates or, one after
another, deprived of them, he kept his mind active and his brain
industriously working for the development of a higher social life under
Christian culture in a virgin land, by his leadership, under the
Providence he devoutly acknowledged, to be fitted and fashioned for a
new and powerful country, of which Boston was to be a memorable city.
</P>

<BR>

<P>
Nor could he fail to remark upon the location of the statue set up in
his honor in Scollay Square, rather than on Boston Common, which he had
laid out and secured to posterity.  The City Square in Charlestown,
where he first unrolled the old charter of the Colony before the new
government at its first meeting here, would have been a better site for
it than the one selected.
</P>

<BR>

<P>
Difficult it is, indeed, to set down in worthy lines the remembrance of
the interview herein depicted.  Of course, it has been faintly and
inadequately done.  Let us hope, however, that, should Winthrop's
spirit, two or three centuries hence, visit again the last and most
eventful scenes of his earthly life, he will find Boston, though
changed anew, yet vastly improved, keeping pace with all developments
for the good of an ever advancing race, and second to none in the
Commonwealth or Nation in true excellence and progress.

There was a quiet hour in Scollay Square;<BR>
The cars and teams were blocked from getting there;<BR>
No longer shone the famed electric light,&mdash;<BR>
It flickered out and left the darkest night.<BR>

For mortals grow no older when they die;<BR>
E'er since my earthly race I long have run,<BR>

Years are not counted on the heavenly shore,<BR>
For in eternal life time is no more.<BR>
The children sweet, the lovely bride forsooth,<BR>
Transferred, preserve the freshness of their youth.<BR>
Those who departed later are not found<BR>
Far to transcend them in their endless round.<BR>

Almost one seventh of the years our Lord<BR>

It learned to live without a cumbrous creed.<BR>
Its 'goodly church,' fast built where flowed the tide,<BR>
Fulfils the vision Wilson saw with pride.<BR>
Its charming chapel opens wide the door<BR>
To the bright children of the suffering poor.<BR>
Ah! blest are they who use for them their might!<BR>
Angels will bear them on their upward flight;<BR>
And, in return, the grateful youth will come,<BR>

With pulpit tones, and songs the choir will sing.<BR>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
